# 84EM

WordPress development consultancy based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

## What We Do

We build custom WordPress solutions for digital agencies and businesses. 

We handle the technical challenges that keep projects moving forward.

## Core Services

- **Custom Plugin Development** – Build functionality that doesn't exist in off-the-shelf solutions
- **WordPress Consulting** – Technical audits and architectural planning, backed by decades of experience
- **Agency Partnerships** – White-label, client-facing, whatever works for you
- **AI Integration & Development** – Custom integrations with LLM APIs, automation pipelines, and workflow tools. Practical implementations, not science projects
- **Site Maintenance & Support** – Keep sites secure, updated, and running smoothly
- **Security & Troubleshooting** – Site compromised? Plugin conflicts? We handle emergencies and security hardening alike
- **Code Cleanup & Refactoring** – Fix messy WordPress code—AI-generated or inherited
- **Data Migrations** – Complex migrations—content, databases, order histories—delivered intact and functional

## Our Approach

We combine deep WordPress expertise with AI-enhanced development workflows. 

Tools like Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and GitHub Copilot help us work efficiently while maintaining code quality and security standards.
